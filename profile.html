              I took my education in Lemlem School of Addis Abeba starting form
              KG1 - 12th grade, here I Participated in some clubs namely Civics
              club and Geography club in social science department and physics
              and math club for natural science department in these clubs I went
              through some interesting situations like participating in mind
              plus math, taking some educational trips to the some of the
              technological sites in Addis Ababa on of which was the water park
              in 6-kilo and record information about the names and use of
              devices used by Ethiopian technicians

            <h3 class="titles">My Hobbies</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Programming personal projects</dt>
              <dd>
                This is what I do when I have free time at home I come up with
                some project ideas on my own and start to code them out using
                proper software engineering procedures. Not all the projects I
                work on are from my own forwishen, most of them are projects
                done before by other programmers in videos or in articles
              </dd>
              <dt>Playing Video Games</dt>
              <dd>
                When I have the time I try some video games to see how they work
                and what types of things are possible to do now a days. Playing
                video games is not really a hobbie per say it is something I do
                whenever I need to find some ideas for projects
              </dd>
              <dt>Cooking</dt>
              <dd>
                Cooking is an art not just a mear action it is a process that
                every software engineer should take part, or at least that is
                what I believe. Cooking is an art for software engineers because
                it is a practical example of when algorithms can be used in real
                life situations
              </dd>
              <dt>Working out</dt>
              <dd>
                Is is quiet a must before and after sleeping and in between
                study sessions. Exersice can be helpful to clear the mind of the
                trubles of education of a short time and recharge the batteries
              </dd>
              <dt>Listening to music</dt>
              <dd>
                This is when I'm stuck on a question or when I'm programming and
                trubleshooting, so listening to music is an activity I reserve
                for solving problems that are simple not complex once where I
                need to design something or solve a really hard question.
              </dd>
              <dt>Playing board games</dt>
              <dd>
                This is more of a family activity where there are guests over at
                the house. I have found this to be a really clever way to study
                when there are people at the house.
              </dd>
              <dt>Reading</dt>
              <dd>
                Reading happens all the time whenever I'm working so I thought
                why not imporove that skill by reading outside of work as well,
                during any activity I seem to be engaged in like walking or just
                sitting somewhere I look for something to read be it out in the
                enviroment I find my self in or on my phone
              </dd>
              <dt>Writing</dt>
              <dd>
                I used to be a bad speller of words even of the most common
                types this has really helped me improve that skill
              </dd>
              <dt>Playing musical instruments</dt>
              <dd>
                This I was told will improve my rethem when I'm doing almost any
                thing like typing or writing or reading. This is more of a
                recent undertaking I'm not really good at it but I'm not giving
                up just yet
              </dd>
              <dt>Solving logic games and puzzles</dt>
              <dd>
                This is an activity reserved for when the light is out at the
                house or when it is lunch time at school and I have nothing
                better to do. Doing this, I hope will improve my problem solving
                skills quiet a bit especially after it is coupled with problem
                solving in leetcode, hackerrank and codeforces
              </dd>
